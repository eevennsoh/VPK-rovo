/**
 * Regenerate every skills-directory catalog entry to the Anthropic "Agent Skills"
 * SKILL.md standard: a full `skillMd` string (YAML frontmatter `---` block +
 * markdown body) plus provenance fields (createdBy / addedBy / lastUpdatedAt).
 *
 * The SKILL.md spec is grounded in the repo's `skill-creator` skill: frontmatter
 * requires `name` (slug) + `description` (when-to-use), optional `allowed-tools`
 * (here = the apps the skill references), `license`, `version`; the body is
 * imperative markdown instructions. We author the frontmatter shape ourselves,
 * so the body content is templated per category for realistic variety rather
 * than run through skill-creator's eval loop 86 times.
 *
 * Deterministic: every value is keyed off a hash of `skill.id` (no Date.now /
 * Math.random) so re-running produces identical output. One-shot scaffold —
 * committed skills.json is the source of truth afterward; this script stays for
 * reference / re-runs. Validates before writing and fails loudly.
 *
 * Frontmatter serialization is imported from the app codec
 * (`app/data/directory/skill-frontmatter.ts`) so generated text always
 * round-trips through the same parser the editor uses.
 *
 * Usage: `pnpm run gen:skill-bodies`
