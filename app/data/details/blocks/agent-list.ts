		'A grouped list of single-row entries styled like the Jira "For you" feed. Each row leads with an identity — hexagon art for an agent, a circular photo for a person — and a title line whose treatment reflects the state: a running session shimmers the work-item title (the shimmer alone signals progress), an awaiting session replaces the title with "Needs input" plus animated dots, an `attention` row keeps its own title beside a warning glyph (for notifications such as "Priya mentioned you"), and a complete session shows a solid title. A metadata line lists optional leading metadata, the time, the actor name, and pull-request status (PR created / PR merged; omitted until a PR exists). Optional `summary` copy wraps below that metadata. Local sessions swap the live runtime and agent name for a static timestamp, a devices glyph, and the machine name. Hovering or keyboard-focusing an agent-session row opens the shared session-details flyout; `flyout="composer"` swaps that for a per-row Agent States card with a prompt composer and agent at-mentions. Non-session rows can opt out via `flyout="none"`. Every actionable row offers a primary action — Reply on person rows, Resume on local sessions, View on cloud agent sessions — plus a hover Archive icon; the action opens the Rovo floating chat in the demo.',
