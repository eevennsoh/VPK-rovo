/**
 * Runtime "created-skills" registry.
 *
 * The static catalog ({@link DEFAULT_SKILLS}, backed by `skills.json`) is read by
 * three paths that assume a fixed set of skills: the `/` editor menu, the
 * skill-tag color/icon lookup (`getSkillMentionTagProps` in the rich-text editor's
 * mention node-view), and the skills directory dialog. When the `create-skill`
 * demo flow generates a brand-new skill at runtime, it must resolve in all three.
 *
 * This is a small module-level store so that:
 * - Non-React code (the Tiptap mention node-view's tag lookup) can read it
 *   synchronously via {@link getCreatedSkills}.
 * - React surfaces can subscribe reactively via {@link useCreatedSkills}.
 *
 * It lives alongside the catalog (rather than under a project folder) because the
 * shared mention node-view consumes it. The store is session-scoped and in-memory
 * (demo only) and starts empty, so no surface changes behavior until a skill is
 * created.
