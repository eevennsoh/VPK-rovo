/**
 * Typed loader + resolver for logo usage metadata. The canonical source of truth
 * is `logo-usage.json` — this module just reads it and exposes typed helpers.
 *
 * The usage decisions are facts about each asset's visual:
 *
 * - 1P product logos (Jira, Confluence, …) ship a solid superellipse background,
 *   so they render bare. The Atlassian master logo has no solid background and
 *   gets a bordered tile (see `oneP.borderById`).
 * - 2P partner logos are bare `/public/2p/<vendor>.png` marks with no background,
 *   so they always need a bordered containing tile.
 * - 3P logos that ship a `/public/3p/<id>/16-borderless.svg` sibling are
 *   "white-tile" marks — the standard `<size>.svg` paints a white background and
 *   a baked 1px hairline. We render these inside a VPK-drawn bordered tile using
 *   the *borderless* variant so the two borders don't double up. Also used for
 *   tight estate (tags) or oversized logos where we build our own border.
 * - 3P logos with no borderless sibling are full-bleed, solid-fill marks (their
 *   own colored superellipse fills the tile). They need no border — same as the
 *   solid-background 1P product logos.
 * - 3P logos listed in `threeP.borderedIds` are the exception to that last rule:
 *   transparent-glyph marks (GitHub Copilot, VS Code) that paint no background
 *   of their own and ship no `16-borderless.svg` to swap to. Without an entry
 *   they fall through to the solid-fill branch and render bare — visibly
 *   inconsistent beside every bordered package mark in the same grid. They get a
 *   border with their base `src` unchanged.
 *
 * `THIRD_PARTY_BORDERLESS_LOGO_IDS` MUST stay in sync with `/public/3p` — the
 * folders that contain a `16-borderless.svg`. `logo-usage.test.js` reads the
 * directory and fails if the JSON drifts, so new 3P assets can't silently bypass
 * the border treatment. The same test asserts `borderedIds` stays disjoint from
 * `borderlessIds`, since `borderlessIds` is checked first.
