/**
 * The board's unread Pulse snapshots, shaped for the floating Rovo button.
 *
 * The selection rules live in `board-insights-nudge`; this is only the
 * translation between a `PulseSnapshot` and the button's row contract, plus the
 * two behaviours the route cannot express in a prop:
 *
 * - **`count` is the total, not `rows.length`.** Rows cap at three, and a card
 *   that says "3 new insights" while five are unread is a lie the reader can
 *   check. `overflowCount` carries the remainder.
 * - **The primary action resumes, it does not restart.** It deep-links to the
 *   *oldest* unread snapshot, because the reader has already read everything
 *   before it and the point of the nudge is to move them forward.
 *
 * Dismissal is deliberately absent from the derivation: it collapses the
 * affordance and nothing else. Only opening the article advances the watermark,
 * so a dismissed nudge comes back with the same count on the next visit — see
 * the module comment on `board-insights-nudge` for why that asymmetry is the
 * design.
