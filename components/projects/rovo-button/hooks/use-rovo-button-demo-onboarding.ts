/**
 * One asset serves the 42x48 hex avatar and the 168x192 banner art.
 *
 * Read this before swapping it — two previous choices failed the same trap.
 *
 * The banner is not the drawing. `onboarding-panel.tsx` renders the art into a
 * 48px-tall strip with `overflow-hidden`, so you only ever see a thin slice cut
 * through the artwork's vertical middle, flush to the card's right edge. What
 * survives that crop depends entirely on the shape of the artwork's centre:
 *
 * - **Rectangular centre plate** — the plate's vertical edges become hard seams
 *   against the flat blue band, and any glyph poking outside the plate gets
 *   clipped mid-shape. The result reads as a broken or mis-tiled image, which
 *   caps the perceived quality of everything else on the card.
 * - **Circular centre** — blue flows continuously around the disc, so there are
 *   no straight edges to read as seams and the glyph stays contained. This is
 *   the only shape that survives.
 *
 * Two consequences worth stating plainly:
 *
 * 1. Every document-themed asset in this set has a rectangular centre, because
 *    a document icon is a rectangle. The assets that match "drafter" are exactly
 *    the ones that mis-tile — there is nothing that is both document-semantic
 *    and strip-clean. This choice trades semantic precision for a clean band,
 *    deliberately.
 * 2. The magnifier reads as "review", not "draft". Adjacent, not exact. It is
 *    acceptable because it carries no *wrong* signal — no prohibition (the
 *    original blocker-checker read as a no-entry sign), no premature checkmark —
 *    and because the card's own prompt line is "Repeating RFP review manually
 *    every time?", which a magnifier matches better than a document would.
 *
 * General lesson: judge the crop at the size and framing it ships in. Both bad
 * picks looked fine inside the whole card at 1x and only fell apart when the
 * 48px strip was viewed in isolation, magnified.
