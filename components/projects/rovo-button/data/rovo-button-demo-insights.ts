 * should stop asking. On this page the button exists to *demonstrate* the
 * insights affordance, so `dismiss` and `select-row` fall back to `"pill"`
 * instead: the card closes, the pill stays, and the next click reopens it.
 * Otherwise the demo dead-ends on the first dismissal and only a reload brings
 * it back.
 *
 * `open-all` still lands on `"hidden"` — it advances the watermark to zero, and
 * a pill advertising nothing would be a lie rather than a demo.
