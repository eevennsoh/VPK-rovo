/**
 * The showcase parks every variant on one evenly spaced row along the bottom
 * edge, numbered right-to-left: slot 0 hugs the right edge and each later slot
 * steps one gap further left.
 *
 * The gap is not cosmetic. A floating button is right-anchored, so when it
 * morphs into a card the card grows *leftward* and can land on top of whichever
 * button sits in the next slots. Slots 0 and 2 are the two card-opening
 * variants, so the step is sized to keep a full card clear of the *other* card's
 * button: two steps (352px) exceeds `ROVO_BUTTON_DEMO_CARD_WIDTH_PX`, leaving
 * 57px of daylight. A card still covers the plain button one slot along, which
 * is unavoidable — the embedded catalog preview is a fixed 846px wide and five
 * buttons plus a 295px card do not both fit.
