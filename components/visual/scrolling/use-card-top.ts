/**
 * The card's laid-out top edge in the ticker list's coordinate space, published
 * as a motion 13 value this package can safely derive from.
 *
 * ## Why this bridge has to exist
 *
 * Ticker's values belong to motion 12 while this package imports motion 13 (the
 * split is explained in `scrolling-offset-bridge.ts`). Neither of the two ways
 * motion 13 would normally consume them works across that boundary:
 *
 * 1. `useTransform(() => tickerValue.get())` — the zero-argument form discovers
 *    dependencies through motion-dom's module-level `collectMotionValues`
 *    singleton. A motion 12 `.get()` registers with motion-dom 12's singleton,
 *    which motion-dom 13 never reads, so NOTHING is collected and the derived
 *    value silently never recomputes.
 * 2. `useTransform([tickerValue], fn)` — the explicit form subscribes correctly
 *    at runtime, but motion 12's `MotionValue` is a nominally distinct class
 *    from motion 13's, so it does not satisfy the overload's `MotionValue<T>[]`
 *    parameter and the call fails to typecheck without a cast.
 *
 * So the crossing is done by hand exactly once, here: `.on("change", …)` is a
 * plain duck-typed method that both runtimes implement identically, and the
 * value it feeds is created by motion 13 and therefore composes normally with
 * every `useTransform` downstream.
 *
 * ## The bug this fixes
 *
 * The depth tail used form (1). It captured only `collapse` (a motion 13 value),
 * which stops changing once the entrance lands — so the scale-and-tuck was
 * computed for wherever each card happened to sit when the unfurl finished and
 * then froze there permanently. Measured in-browser before this bridge existed:
 * after a 280px drag every card's scale was byte-identical while the cards had
 * moved a third of the scrollport, and forcing a React re-render snapped them
 * all to the correct values for their new positions.

/**
 * The same live position, with the term every copy shares removed: this DOM
 * copy's place in the LOOP, published as a motion 13 value.
 *
 * `cardTop` is `renderedOffset + start + projection` and `renderedOffset` is one
 * number shared by every copy on the list, so ORDERING cards by `cardTop` and
 * ordering them by `start + projection` give exactly the same sequence. What
 * differs is how often the number moves: `cardTop` changes every frame the list
 * scrolls, while `start` is static per copy (Ticker offsets each clone group's
 * bounds by a whole period, so it is unique and monotonic in DOM order) and
 * `projection` only ever steps between `0` and `listSize` as the loop teleports
 * a card to the far end.
 *
 * That makes this the right input for anything that needs the cards' live
 * ORDER rather than their live position — {@link stackZIndex} above all, whose
 * result has to be written to the DOM and would otherwise be rewritten for
 * every card on every frame of a drag.
 *
 * Crosses the motion 12/13 boundary exactly the same way, and for exactly the
 * same reasons, as {@link useCardTop}.
