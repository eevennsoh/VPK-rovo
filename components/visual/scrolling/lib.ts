/**
 * Pure, dependency-free logic for the Scrolling ticker.
 *
 * NO React and NO Motion imports live here on purpose: every export is a plain
 * function so `lib.test.ts` can exercise it under `node --test`.
 *
 * Three separate concerns share the file, and they are genuinely unrelated to
 * each other — the header below about totality applies only to the first:
 *
 * 1. **Entrance fan geometry** — {@link fanOffset}, {@link fanOpacity} and the
 *    opacity knots. The rest of the entrance geometry (the anchor, and which
 *    DOM copies take part) lives in `stack-layout.ts`, because it is shared
 *    with the deck/depth knobs that file owns.
 * 2. **Input normalisation** — {@link shouldCaptureWheel} and
 *    {@link isKeyboardFocus} answer "is this input ours?" for a listener, and
 *    both are the single authority for a rule two hooks depend on;
 *    {@link wheelDeltaPx} then puts the claimed wheel delta into pixels.
 * 3. **The focus-reveal solver** — {@link focusRevealOffset} and its geometry
 *    record, used only by `use-scrolling-focus.ts`.
 *
 * ## Why every function is total
 *
 * These results are written straight into Motion `MotionValue`s. A single
 * non-finite frame PERMANENTLY poisons a `MotionValue`: once `NaN` lands, every
 * later spring/inertia read derives from the poisoned current value and stays
 * `NaN` for the lifetime of the value, with no visible error. The same hazard is
 * documented in `components/blocks/gallery/hooks/use-dock-magnification.ts` and
 * `components/blocks/agent-session/agent-session-notch-magnify.ts`.
 *
 * The inputs really are untrustworthy: motion-plus' Ticker reports
 * `{ start: 0, end: 0 }` for every item and `containerLength: 0` until it has
 * measured, and `parseInt` on a container padding string can yield `NaN`. So
 * every function below returns a finite number for EVERY input, including
 * `NaN`, `Infinity`, `-Infinity` and `undefined`.

 * Collapse values at which the fade knots sit, highest first.

 * `:focus-visible` is the browser's own answer to that question — the same

 *   the pointer leaving, just because a click focused a card action.
 * - `use-scrolling-focus.ts` must not scroll the list on a mouse press. Its
 *   reveal exists so a Tab stop inside the edge fade becomes visible; running
 *   it on a click near the fade moved the list out from under the pointer and

/**
 * Ticker offset delta that brings a focused control as far inside the UNMASKED
 * band of the scrollport as Ticker's loop allows, or `0` when it already is.
 *
 * ## Why this is a solver and not a DOM-measured nudge
 *
 * The obvious implementation — measure the control with `getBoundingClientRect`
 * and add the shortfall to `offset` — assumes the control's on-screen y is an
 * affine function of `offset` with slope 1. Ticker breaks that at two coincident
 * discontinuities: the offset is wrapped into `[-(pitch + inset), -inset)`, and
 * each item's projection flips between `0` and `listSize` the instant its bottom
 * passes the port's top edge. Those two cancel exactly while `listSize === pitch`
 * (no clones) and leave a residual of `pitch * cloneCount` otherwise.
 *
 * Measured in-browser before this solver existed: at `viewportHeight` 480 every
 * Tab stop landed exactly where the nudge predicted, but at 540 and above —
 * where `calcNumClones` starts cloning — the same nudge overshot by exactly one
 * `pitch` (592px), parking the focus ring 492px below a 600px port, and a
 * second Tab wrote a full period, which is a no-op, so the stop stayed stuck
 * off-screen permanently.
 *
 * So solve in the ticker's own space instead. A card's top edge, in scrollport
 * coordinates, is exactly
 *
 * ```text
 * cardTop(v) = start + v + (v + end <= 0 ? listSize : 0),  v = wrappedOffset + inset
 * ```
 *
 * which is the same model `stack-layout.ts`'s `cardTopFrom` encodes. That gives
 * one candidate per projection branch, each clamped to its own domain. Both are
 * scored by how many px of the control still fall outside the safe band and the
 * lower score wins, so an unreachable target degrades to the closest reachable
 * position rather than to a wild jump.
 *
 * ## The residual this cannot fix
 *
 * With `cloneCount >= 1` the reachable positions of an original `.ticker-item`
 * have a HOLE in them, and for the first item (`start === 0`) that hole swallows
 * the whole safe band between roughly 540 and 710px of viewport height — the
 * visible slot is occupied by an inert `.clone-item`. Ticker only ever
 * reprojects forward, so no offset exists that clears the fade for that stop,
 * and `safeMargin` does not help: its backward branch needs
 * `start >= visibleLength + safeMargin`, which the first item never satisfies.
 * The solver clamps to flush-top there — visible, inside the fade — which is the
 * best reachable position, verified by sweeping a full period in the browser.
 *
 * Returns `0` for any non-finite or pre-measurement input; a scroller that
 * refuses to move is always better than one that writes `NaN` into the offset
 * (see this file's header).
