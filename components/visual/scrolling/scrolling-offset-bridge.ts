/**
 * The `MotionValue` the ticker scrolls. It must be one Ticker created itself.
 *
 * motion-plus pins `motion ^12` and pnpm gives it its own copy, so every
 * MotionValue it makes belongs to motion 12 while this repo imports motion 13.
 * That split is NOT cosmetic. Ticker derives its rendered offset with the
 * zero-argument `useTransform(() => … offset.get())`, whose dependency tracking
 * runs through a module-level `collectMotionValues` singleton inside motion-dom:
 * a motion 13 value registers with motion-dom 13's singleton while motion-plus
 * reads motion-dom 12's, so a value created here would never be subscribed to
 * and the list would never move. Verified in-browser before this bridge existed
 * — the wheel handler wrote the offset and called `preventDefault`, and the
 * list's transform stayed at its initial value through drag and wheel alike.
 *
 * Motion's React contexts are split for the same reason: do not expect
 * `AnimatePresence`, `LayoutGroup` or `MotionConfig` to reach the cards.

 * written here belong to the motion copy motion-plus resolves (see
 * {@link TickerOffset}), so naming either package's class would force a cast.
 * Both satisfy this shape, and all three methods are duck-typed identically in
 * the two runtimes.
 *
 * {@link TickerOffset} is the other, NOMINAL half of the same story and is not
 * interchangeable with this one: it is Ticker's own prop type, needed wherever
 * a value is handed back to motion-plus (`_dragY`) or wherever the full
 * `MotionValue` API — `jump`, subscriptions — is used.
