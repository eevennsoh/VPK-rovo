/**
 * Scrolls the keyboard-focused card action into the unmasked part of the
 * scrollport.
 *
 * Ticker ships its own version of this in `use-focus-navigation.mjs` and it
 * cannot work here. `applyFocusOffset()` scrolls with
 * `focusOffset.set(-element.offsetTop)`, but Ticker gives every `.ticker-item`
 * `<li>` an inline `position: relative` and the session card's `<article>` is
 * `relative` too, so `offsetTop` resolves against the CARD the control lives in
 * rather than the list. Measured in-browser at the default 480px viewport: all
 * 16 actions report `offsetTop === 18`, the ticker offset freezes at -18 for the
 * whole keyboard walk, and the last card's actions sit at y 516-540 inside a
 * 480px `overflow: clip` box — an entirely invisible focus indicator.
 *
 * So suppress that trap and do the scrolling here:
 *
 * 1. A CAPTURE-phase `focus` listener on the region. Capture runs
 *    outermost-first and the region is the parent of Ticker's own container, so
 *    stopping propagation means Ticker's `handleFocus` never fires and
 *    `startFocusTrap` never runs. `renderedOffset` then stays the wrapped
 *    `offset` this component already owns — which is also what makes the solver
 *    below valid, since a trapped Ticker swaps `renderedOffset` for its own
 *    `focusOffset`.
 * 2. A `focusin` listener that SOLVES for the target offset in the ticker's own
 *    coordinate space (see {@link focusRevealOffset}) and writes the exact
 *    difference — but only for KEYBOARD focus (see {@link isKeyboardFocus}).
 *
 * ## Why the reveal is keyboard-only
 *
 * A mouse press on a button raises `focusin` exactly like Tab does. Reacting to
 * both meant that pressing a card action inside the bottom fade scrolled the
 * list out from under the pointer between `pointerdown` and `pointerup`, so the
 * `click` never landed on the control and the press was silently swallowed —
 * the keyboard fix breaking the mouse. `isKeyboardFocus` is the same
 * discrimination `use-scrolling-gestures.ts` already applies before it engages
 * the wheel on focus, lifted into `lib.ts` so the two listeners cannot drift.
 *
 * Nothing is lost by skipping the pointer case: the user can see the control
 * they just pressed, and they chose to press it where it was.
 *
 * ## Why solving beats nudging
 *
 * The previous implementation measured the shortfall with
 * `getBoundingClientRect` and added it to `offset`. That is only valid while a
 * card's on-screen y is an affine function of `offset` with slope 1, which
 * Ticker guarantees ONLY while it renders no clones. From `viewportHeight` 540
 * up it clones, and the nudge overshot by exactly one loop period: measured at
 * 600, the first Tab stop landed 492px BELOW a 600px port, and the second Tab
 * computed a full-period delta, which the wrap makes a no-op, so the stop was
 * stuck off screen for good. With `depth="bottom"` three consecutive stops had
 * no focus indicator anywhere in the port.
 *
 * Only three things are still measured live, and each of them has to be:
 * `intraTop` (which absorbs the depth tail's scale, since it is taken from the
 * `<li>`'s rect rather than the card's laid-out box), the control's height, and
 * the port height. Everything else comes from Ticker's own measurement via
 * {@link ScrollingTickerGeometry}.
 *
 * ## The one bounded re-measure
 *
 * The depth tuck rescales a card as it moves, so `intraTop` and the control
 * height are both slightly stale the moment the list lands somewhere new —
 * measured at 480/`depth="bottom"`, six stops settled 6-21px past the safe
 * band. A single `requestAnimationFrame` pass after the write absorbs that.
 * Exactly one pass: unbounded iteration oscillates on the stops the loop simply
 * cannot place (see {@link focusRevealOffset}).
 *
 * The region and Ticker's container share one box (the region carries the
 * explicit height, the container is `h-full w-full`), so the region rect is the
 * scrollport rect.
