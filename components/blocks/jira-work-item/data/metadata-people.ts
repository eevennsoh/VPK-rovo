 *
 * The roster mirrors the rich-text editor's "People and team" palette so the
 * assignee picker offers the same full directory of people. The palette humans
 * come from `SAMPLE_AGENT_PEOPLE`; we map them to `WorkItemPerson` and drop the
 * permission `role` (manager/editor/user) since it isn't a meaningful subtitle
 * in an assignee picker. A small curated set of role-titled people is appended
 * for names the work-item fixtures reference that aren't in the directory.
