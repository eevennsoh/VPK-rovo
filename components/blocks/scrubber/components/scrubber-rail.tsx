 * pins itself inside both ends instead of overhanging them. Those two must share
 * one duration and easing or the position and the self-offset animate out of
 * step and the pill visibly wobbles — hence a single `transition-[left,transform]`
 * carrying one `duration-*`/`ease-*` pair. `motion-reduce:transition-none` is the
 * guard: VPK's duration tokens keep playing otherwise, and unlike a JS check it
 * also holds on the pre-hydration render.
