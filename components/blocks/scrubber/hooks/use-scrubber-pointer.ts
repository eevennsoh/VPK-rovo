/**
 * Pointer scrubbing plus the swell, sharing one pointer position.
 *
 * Two cadences on purpose. `pointerOffset` updates every frame and drives the
 * rules through motion values, which write straight to the DOM — a rail of
 * twenty-eight rules re-rendering through React on every mouse pixel would
 * stall the row it sits in. The consumer only hears about a change when the
 * *nearest entry* actually changes, so a fast sweep does not strobe.
 *
 * `magnify` is animated separately so the swell fades out on leave rather than
 * snapping. It is a plain 0–1 scalar and the parked pointer is a finite -1: an
 * Infinity or NaN written into a motion value poisons it permanently.
