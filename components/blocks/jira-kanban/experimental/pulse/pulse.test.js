/**
 * Pulse — the experimental Kanban's timeline mode.
 *
 * Pulse is one continuous article: every insight is on the page at once and the
 * reader scrolls through them, with the ruler on the left as the document's
 * outline. That reshaped what this suite can execute. `usePulseTimeline` no
 * longer owns a snapshot index or a member filter, and it no longer carries the
 * whole mounted snapshot — the position belongs to `usePulseReading`, the filter
 * to `usePulseMemberFilter`, and the per-insight scoping to the article, which
 * derives it for all seven. Tests that used to drive `goToNext`/`goToIndex` or
 * read `host.current.artifacts` say so where they changed.
 *
 * The contracts worth protecting are behavioural, so they are executed rather
 * than grepped: the hooks' derivations run for real against the fixture. That
 * is all this file holds. Source-level assertions — what cannot be executed in
 * Node — moved to `pulse-source-contracts.test.js`.
 *
 * The outline that both the ruler and the article are built from lives in
 * `pulse-outline.test.js`; the ruler's own drawing and pointer gesture live in
 * `pulse-scrubber.test.js`; the fixture is walked in `pulse-fixture.test.js`;
 * the "Needs input" agent list is in `pulse-attention.test.js`; the
 * "Next best actions" mapping is in `pulse-next-actions.test.js`.
