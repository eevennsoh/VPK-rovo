/**
 * Pulse fixture — one sprint week of the `PAY` Payments SDK v2 migration.
 *
 * Monday 17 August through Friday 21 August 2026. Seven snapshots, each a real
 * decision point rather than a status update. Each insight records when it was
 * generated and when it was last updated — an outcome can be revised after it
 * first appears. Those clocks are deliberately uneven; the ruler ignores them
 * and steps insights evenly, because spacing counts outcomes, not elapsed time.
 *
 * All date and time strings are pre-formatted here on purpose: formatting at
 * render time drifts between server and client.

			"Rollback is proven rather than assumed: 200 synthetic payments through the v2 path, the flag pulled mid-flight, a clean ledger in four minutes eleven seconds, and both in-flight 3-D Secure challenges completing on v1. The rehearsal also surfaced the one failure paper would have missed — ledger-sync stamps the SDK version at intent time, so a rollback leaves rows marked v2 against payments that settled on v1, which is harmless for reconciliation and poisonous for a finance export that groups by that field. Writing the version at settlement time instead is an 88-line fix, now PAY-128. The procedure you would actually need at three in the morning is spread across a draft run log, a vendor console and a branch nobody linked.",

			"The migration itself is done: all 61 call sites ported, LegacyGatewayAdapter deleted, 4,180 lines gone, retry living in payments-api where it can be reasoned about, and a flag with per-account targeting and an armed kill switch. Two things stand between here and Monday — PAY-112 waits on the sandbox key retention window before anyone signs off on replaying keys against live accounts, and PAY-130's eleven decline strings entered a five working day localisation queue on a Friday afternoon. Neither blocks the first slice, which is one percent of traffic on a single English-only account, so Monday is possible and Wednesday is likely; the targeting rule is written and deliberately unapproved. The strongest argument for moving faster, v2 running 42 ms quicker at p95, exists only as an unlinked commit.",
