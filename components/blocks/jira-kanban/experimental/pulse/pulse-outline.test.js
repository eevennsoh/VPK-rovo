/**
 * Pulse outline — the one model behind both the ruler and the article.
 *
 * Pulse is a single continuous document: every insight is on the page and the
 * reader scrolls through them. `buildPulseOutline` is what makes the ruler and
 * the prose incapable of disagreeing — the marks are generated from the same
 * entries the article is built from, and every mark is a real scroll anchor.
 *
 * All of it is pure, so all of it is executed rather than grepped. The suite
 * feeds deliberately lopsided clocks, because the property that matters is that
 * the clock cannot reach the geometry at all.
