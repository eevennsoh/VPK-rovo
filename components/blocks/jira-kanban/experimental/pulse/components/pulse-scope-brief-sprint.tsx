/**
 * Sprint scope brief — the opening of the article once it is narrowed to one
 * sprint.
 *
 * Jira answers this question with two bordered cards, a chart and a tinted
 * banner: three surfaces to carry three facts. Pulse has no card chrome to
 * spend, so the brief earns its hierarchy the way the rest of the article does
 * — one eyebrow, one display headline, one line of prose, then blocks
 * separated by air and hairlines. Everything the reference prints is here; none
 * of the boxes it prints it in are.
 *
 * Three decisions are worth naming.
 *
 * The verdict is written out. The reference draws a burndown and never says
 * whether the sprint lands, which is the only reason a lead opens a burndown.
 * The sentence above the figure states it — done, remaining, and whether the
 * line is ahead of, level with, or behind the guideline — so the figure becomes
 * evidence for a claim the reader has already been given rather than a puzzle.
 *
 * The figure is drawn, not emitted. It stretches to the reading measure with
 * `preserveAspectRatio="none"` and pins every stroke to
 * `vector-effect="non-scaling-stroke"`, so hairlines stay hairlines at any
 * column width instead of shearing into wedges. Nothing round and nothing
 * typeset lives inside the SVG: the axis labels and the today dot are HTML,
 * absolutely positioned. Vertically that is exact — the element is the same
 * number of pixels tall as the viewBox is units, so a grid line's `y` is
 * already a `top`. Horizontally the gutter is a fixed fraction of the viewBox,
 * so one percentage aligns the axis column at every width. The result is real
 * type on the type ramp and a perfectly round marker, which an SVG under
 * horizontal stretch cannot give.
 *
 * The scope-change banner loses its tint. A pale blue box exists in the
 * reference to make three signed numbers feel like a warning; here the numbers
 * carry their own direction — a signed figure, coloured only on the sign — and
 * the net is stated in a sentence above them. The rows then reuse the article's
 * ruled `<dl>` rhythm, so the sprint's arithmetic reads on the same rails as
 * every other set of numbers in the piece.
 *
 * Nothing here animates. The brief is the top of a document the reader has just
 * asked for; motion would only delay the first line.
 */

/**

 * one and you must change the other.

 * The chart ramp is a colour key — it exists so a swatch can be matched to a
 * band — and `text-red-500` (#E2483D) is tuned for a filled mark rather than
 * for 18px type: axe measures it at 3.7:1 on the page surface, under AA. A
