/**
 * The card the vertical rail floats in.
 *
 * No border: overlay elevation already defines the surface, and stacking a border on
 * top of `shadow-overlay` double-outlines it (`.agents/rules/gotchas-ui.md`).
 *
 * The width is load-bearing rather than taste. A vertical mark draws its rule rightward
 * from the rail's left edge and swells to 46px, so the rail column (24px) plus the gap
 * has to clear that before the pill column starts — `gap-5` puts the pill at 44px, two
 * short of the peak, which is the closest the two can sit without a swollen major
 * reaching under a label. 184px then leaves the pill column 116px, enough for the
 * longest heading the demo timeline carries.
 *
 * The rail is deliberately *not* reversed onto the other side of the card even though
 * the card docks to the right edge: reversing it would point the swell at the screen
 * edge, where the card's own padding would clip it.

 * panel is: that rail is a bottom-anchored strip with pointer events disabled, so a
