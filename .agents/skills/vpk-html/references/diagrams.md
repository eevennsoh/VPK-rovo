# Diagrams

vpk-html ships 39 standalone SVG diagram and chart primitives at
`assets/diagrams/*.html`: 14 original structural/chart primitives plus 25 Phase
E chart additions. They are data-shape diagrams in the Algebrica figure
language: grayscale, token-only, flat, precise, and typography-led. For
object/assembly/mechanism drawings, use `references/illustrations.md` and
`assets/illustrations/`.

Read `references/svg-style.md` before drawing or modifying any SVG. For chart
work, also read `references/charts.md` before editing animation, interaction,
or chart-type behavior.

## How To Use A Diagram

Each diagram file is a complete standalone HTML page with an inline SVG. To
embed a diagram in a long-doc, portfolio, design-system, or other rich
template:

1. Open `assets/diagrams/<type>.html`.
2. Copy the SVG block.
3. Place it inside a `<figure>` in the filled document.
4. Replace placeholder labels inside the SVG with real values.
5. Run `check-html.mjs` on the finished artifact.

```html
<figure>
	<svg viewBox="0 0 960 460" aria-label="Production architecture" fill="none">
		<!-- pasted SVG content -->
	</svg>
	<figcaption>FIG_001 - The origin path is the only focal path.</figcaption>
</figure>
```

Before drawing, ask: would a well-written paragraph teach the reader less than
this diagram? If no, skip the diagram.

## Selection Guide - By Intent

| Reader should learn... | Diagram |
|---|---|
| What talks to what | `architecture` |
| What happens in what order | `flowchart`, `timeline` |
| Who owns each step | `swimlane` |
| How the parts nest | `tree`, `layer-stack` |
| What overlaps with what | `venn` |
| What's bigger / smaller / changing | `bar-chart`, `line-chart`, `waterfall`, `slope-chart`, `dumbbell`, `lollipop`, `bullet` |
| How observations are distributed | `box-plot`, `histogram`, `ridgeline`, `beeswarm`, `dot-strip` |
| How a trend compares to events, baseline, range, or peers | `annotated-line`, `index-chart`, `band-chart`, `small-multiples`, `stacked-area` |
| Where intensity concentrates | `calendar-heatmap`, `matrix-heatmap`, `grid-choropleth` |
| How parts fill a total or hierarchy | `donut-chart`, `waffle`, `treemap`, `icicle` |
| How entities relate or flow | `sankey`, `arc-diagram`, `scatter`, `connected-scatter` |
| What's in each quadrant of a 2x2 | `quadrant` |
| What state are we in, and how do we move | `state-machine` |
| How this breaks down into parts of a whole | `donut-chart` |
| How this price moved over time | `candlestick` |

## The Focal Rule

Every ordinary diagram gets one darkest-ink focal element:

- focal stroke/fill: `var(--focal)`
- focal stroke-width: `2`
- everything else: `--ill-*`, `--rule*`, `--muted-text`, or `--subtlest-text`

If more than one node feels important, the diagram is probably doing too much.
Split it or demote the supporting nodes. `build.mjs --check-focal --strict`
counts `var(--focal)` in ordinary SVGs and fails when a diagram exceeds the
configured threshold.

## Token Map

| Role | Token |
|---|---|
| Paper / SVG background | `--paper` |
| Default ink | `--ink` |
| Focal node/path | `--focal` |
| Primary linework | `--ill-line` |
| Secondary label | `--ill-ink50` |
| Guide / axis | `--ill-guide` |
| Dashed guide | `--ill-guide-dashed` |
| Frame | `--ill-frame` |
| Primary fill | `--ill-fill`, `--ill-tone2` |
| Alternate fill | `--ill-fill-alt`, `--ill-tone1` |
| Deep fill / construction tone | `--ill-tone3`, `--ill-hatch` |
| Heatmap intensity | `--heat0` through `--heat4` |

Labels, chart numbers, figure identifiers, and technical callouts inside SVGs
use Geist Mono at 11-13px when possible. Smaller labels are allowed only when
the diagram geometry demands it.

## Multi-Series Without Hue

Do not use color to distinguish series. Use combinations of:

- tone: `--ill-line`, `--ill-ink50`, `--rule-strong`
- dash: solid, `stroke-dasharray="4"`, `stroke-dasharray="8 6"`
- marker: circle, square, triangle, hollow point
- ordering: put the focal series on top and draw it with stroke-width 2

For bars, combine fill tone and a small marker or direct label. For lines,
combine stroke tone, dash pattern, and point marker. For heatmap-like
intensity charts, use the warm mauve ramp `--heat0` through `--heat4`.

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-pattern | Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Two focal elements | Multiple `--focal` nodes compete | Pick one, demote the rest |
| Hue series | Lines differ only by color | Use tone, dash, and marker |
| Mystery axis | Units or time anchors missing | Label the axis or remove it |
| Overlapping nodes | Semantic overlap is unclear | Move nodes apart or split the diagram |
| Decorative chart | It repeats the paragraph | Delete it |
| Caption echo | Caption restates the title | State the insight |

## Regenerating Diagrams

The committed diagrams are migrated in place because the local Kami upstream
has no source assets. For shared CSS/font/token refreshes, use:

```bash
node .agents/skills/vpk-html/scripts/migrate-identity.mjs
node .agents/skills/vpk-html/scripts/retrofit.mjs
node .agents/skills/vpk-html/scripts/build.mjs --check-templates
```

For advisory checks against finished documents:

```bash
node .agents/skills/vpk-html/scripts/build.mjs --check-focal <file> --strict
node .agents/skills/vpk-html/scripts/build.mjs --check-caption-echo <file>
```
